simplifyData(data, minVar) # simplifies the data to achieve min x variance
binaryizeData(data) # makes data binary
loadAllData()

tests:
(2.1.2)
Shows variances 

(2.1.3)
Success vs K for 80%, 90%, 95%, 99% var 
Time vs K for 80%, 90%, 95%, 99% var

(2.2)
Use normalization on best parameter from (2.1.3) and 
 apply KNN with 
 - cross validation, 
 - 10 runs, 
 - 90/10 split
 - apply normalization before and after (to binarize the data)

find success and time for one K and one Var.

(2.3)
Split data set to both
 - data from all in train
 - data from all, but the one from test, in the train set
