\subsection{K-NN Theory}
The K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) method is in this report used to classify a specific unknown character to a set of characters ranging from 0 to 9.
The method utilizes the euclidean distance to the nearest characters in the training set.

Knowing the K nearest neighbours to a unknown character, then the character can be classified depending on the surrounding pixels.
This is done by taking the most often occurring character within the K-NN and assuming this is also the same character.
