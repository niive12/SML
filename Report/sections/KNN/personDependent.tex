\subsection{Person Dependent}
This section tests the KNN algorithm explained earlier using data from one single person, namely Group three member two's data.
The test are performed first with the data split equally into a 50\% for the training and 50\% for the test set.
Afterwards with a 90/10\% split for training and test respectively is computed.
Both test where conducted using cross validation with 10 runs.

\subsubsection{Equally Sized training and test set}
Figure \ref{fig:PersonDependentPerformance_5050} shows a test with 50/50\% split was carried out for changing \textit{K}'s.

\end{figure}

As seen on figure \ref{fig:PersonDependentPerformance_5050} then \textbf{...}.


\subsubsection{90/10 Data Split}
A cross validation was also carried out using a 90/10\% split of the data. 
The result of this is seen in figure \ref{fig:PersonDependentPerformance_9010}.
