\caption{Success rate for detection of characters of on person when not in the training set. 
Data normalized before (pre) and after (post) dataset reduction using PCA.
PCA was set to ensure that 80\% of all variance was included in the data set and K as 19.
The person tested for is given as 'Group':'Member'.
It was tested with 16 people.}
