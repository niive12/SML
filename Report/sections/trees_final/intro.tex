A decision is a choice between two options.
If a selected pixel is colored a certain way then it might mean one number is more likely to have been written than another.
Decision trees are a set of binary decisions which leads to a classification.
Each node in the tree contains a split and a two sub nodes.
The left sub node is chosen if the test data is below the split. 
The right sub node is chosen if the test data is above the split.
The optimal split is where the most information is gained.
Information gain can be calculated by knowing the uncertainty before and the uncertainty after a split.
To find the optimal split the entropy is estimated.
