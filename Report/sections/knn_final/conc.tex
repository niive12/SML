\subsection{Conclusion}



Multiple test were performed to find the best possible way to optimize the time taken to run and the success gained from using the K-NN algorithm.
It was chosen to use 40 PC to optimize speed, while keeping a descend success rate.
Furthermore it was found to benefit the success rate when smoothing the data using a Gaussian filter with sigma of 0.9 and a filter size of 5.
The success rate was also improved by applying z-score normalization.
