\subsection{Theory}
The K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) method is in this report used to classify a unknown digit to a set of known digits ranging from zero to nine.
The data is split into two groups: One is for training and one is for testing. 
The nearest neighbour is found using the euclidean distance to the pixel values in a training set with known values.
The result is a vote between the K closest neighbours.

To see how this method performs a multitude of tests are performed to see how multiple parameters affect the success rate and the speed.
