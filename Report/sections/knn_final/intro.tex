The K-NN algorithm is a brute-force algorithm used to classify test objects by comparing them to a set of already classified objects.
How this is used to classify the set of different classes and how the algorithm works is explored in this section.
Furthermore the effect of applying various preprocessing methods before hand on the data is explored.
