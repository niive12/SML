\subsection{Naive Bayes Optimization}
\textbf{LAPLACE}

To find one of the the best settings for the Naive Bayes, a contour for the number of bins and the accumulated variance in the PCA analysis was made.

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{graphics/contour_bins_vs_pca}
\caption{Contour of the success rate of the Naive Bayes with accumulated PCA going from 0.3 to 1 and the number of bins from 2 to 20.
The data was normalized using z-score first and the Laplace value was set to 1.
The contour was created with G3M2 data in the test set and the remaining 15 loadable datasets in the training set.}

From figure \ref{fig:contour_bin-vs-pca} it can be seen that the best point is with XX bins and an accumulative PCA of 0.X.
These values for bins, PCA and Laplace are then used to compare all people with the rest of the class in figure \ref{fig:comp_naiveBayes}.

\caption{Comparison of Naive Bayes for one person with the rest of the class.
Where bins is XXX, PCA is YYY and laplace is ZZZ.}
