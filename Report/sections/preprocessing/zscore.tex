\subsection{Z-Score}
The z-score can be used to normalizes the data.
This transforms the range of the data points measured into a standard range.
The formula to calculate the z-score is given in equation \ref{eq:zscore}.

\begin{equation}
X_{new} = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\label{eq:zscore}
\end{equation}


The z-score transforms the values into a number representing how many standard deviations the value is from the mean.
