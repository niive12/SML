The preprocessing of the data used for machine learning is of huge relevance.
Preprocessing methods can be used to both reduce the classification time or increase the success rate.
The same is however also the case, when not applied correctly.
This section will therefore present the preprocessing methods used throughout this report.
Furthermore it is explained how these methods are applied to the data gathered.
