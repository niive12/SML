\subsection{Principle Component Analysis}
The Principle Components Analysis (PCA) is an tool that can be used to describe the variance in a data set.

PCA aims to reduce the number of dimension used to represent the features of the data.
This is done by finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues to the training set and removing some of the components representing the least variance in the data set.
Thus efficiently reducing the dimensions, but still keeping the most significant knowledge about the features.

By selecting the most significant principle components (PC) the data set can be systematically reduced with minimal changes to performance.
In figure \ref{fig:variance} is the variance and accumulated variance shown for the first 20 PC. 
It is seen that the first PC is the most significant and the variance converges towards zero with more PC.

% Figure \ref{fig:contour_KvsPCA_G3M2vsRest} shows a contour plot of how well Group 3 Member 2's  handwriting was predicted successfully for $K$ and the total variance represented of the PC's varying between one and 20 and 0.5 and 1 respectively.


Calculating with less data will result in a faster computation time.
Choosing too few PC means there is no features left to compare.
To see how the performance and the timing scales both are shown in figure \ref{fig:pca_timing_lukas} and \ref{fig:pca_timing_nikolaj}. K was chosen to be 10.
In figure \ref{fig:pca_timing_lukas} the performance seems to be the same regardless of how many PC is chosen. As long as there are more than 60 the performance will be the same.
On the test done on Group member 1 the performance is worse which means the digits are less uniform. 
Here the success rate has a peak with a low set of attributes so there must be some confusion that gets sorted out. 
Both test were run with 100 DPI. The percentage of successful predictions is also measured with the same data.
The timing was measured on the same computer so the difference should not be very large.

To get a closer look at how the PCA performs the data from G3M2 was tested against the rest of the class. 
The K was chosen to be 10. 
The data is shown in figure \ref{fig:pca_success}.
The performance is getting worse as more features are considered.
